### Hi there, I'm Daniel 👋

💼 Currently working as a Data Analyst at [Matatika](https://www.matatika.com/), exploring new ways to use and get the most out of data.

📊 On the data side I've been mostly using Python, SQL, dbt, Snowflake, Postgres, Jupyter Notebooks and recently ChatGPT.

👨‍💻 Also been building and maintaining our API using Java, as well as our App with React, Javascript, HTML & CSS.

✍️ Occasionally I write articles and posts about all things data, find my medium link below!
